# About
This repository hosts the source code of my paper, "Implementation of Vector, Linear Transformation, and Quaternion Algebra in the Creation and Manipulation of Bézier Curves for 3D Computer Graphics," that I made for an assignment in the IF2123 Linear and Geometry Algebra class I took in late 2024, including the $\LaTeX$ code for the paper. 

For this assignment, we were tasked to create a scientific paper regarding the topics discussed in the class. I chose vectors, linear transformations, and quaternions. Please do not expect much from me as I am just a beginner. I am, by any means, not a professional researcher in this field.

In this paper, I demonstrated how to create a Bézier curve from vectors (i.e. its control points) and to manipulate them using linear transformation for dilation and shear, and using quaternion for rotation. I used OpenGL (with GLGF) in Python to create imageries of Bézier curves.

# Installation
Navigate using `cd` to the directory of this repository and install the required packages using `pip`:

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

Next, you can run `main.py` in the folder `src`. Have fun! :D

# Best Regards
I believe you can do better!
